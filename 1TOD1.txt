How to test flow from middle of flow
	let say there are 3 backend endpoints

two objects have same method need to call that method, we can create generic method 
	private void mone(T o){
		o.run();
	}
list.forEach() does not return but we need return value
	T t = new T();
	list.forEach( l - one(t, l));
	//now we have modified t available
	
how to create class inside class(inner calss will be created as public static but )
	with Intellij
		move one file on to other file
	problem: all method parameters will have extra outer class name
	
to delete 200k records it taking 1 hr(without index)

first method takes x returns y and pass it to second method,
	in change request(CR) requirment, second method needs some thing from first method
	
use builder pattern	
do not pass entire object as parameter if you need just one or two propeties needed
do not call method until it actuall needed
	(like call method A, and do some logc and use method A optout- this is wrong)
do not call method c in method A
	methodA(){
		var c= method c();
		methodB(c)
	}
	here insted of calling method C in method A, we can directly call method C in method B only
but do not call method in loops if you are not passing to method from loop iteration item
if we are checking same condition multiple times in one mthod
	move code to new method  check condition only one time
	mone (){
		------
		codition1{
			-----
		}
		
		----
		codition1{
			-----
		}
	}
	change above code to something like below
	mone (){
		------
		codition1{
			mtwo()
		}else {
			---
		}
		-----
	}
	
	mtwo(){
		----
	}
	
	
how to combine two queries results in to single resultset, what are pre conditions to combine


Collections.EMPTY_LIST //do not use
Collections.emptyList() // use this
.stream().mapToDouble(amt -> amt.getAmount() != null ? amt.getAmount() : 0).sum() //sum of one field of collection objects

Refactor
-----------------------------------------------------------------
always think that feature requirment is same as existing but only last method call we need to chage
	mone()-->l1- l2 -l3
	mtwo()-->l1- l2 -l5
	l1 , l2 should not be duplicated in mtwo() requirment


one end point is call service method 
	but service method S1m1() has to to invoke multiple vendors
		vendor A, B we seprate feign client 
		in service method  i have 4 method calls
			1.AVendorReqCreate
			2.AVendorResCreate
			3.BVendorReqCreate
			4.BVendorResCreate
New requirment 
 create new endponit 
	endpoint two service method S2m1() has to call Vendor B and C
	but B methods are in service S1 
Solution: create service calsses for each vendor




VM
--------------------------------------
what do we need to build application
	access to computer
	what type of computer
	how much hard disk/ ram
	OS
	program softwares
	
----------------------------
zero trust authentication
https/grpc

	

Object storage
----------------------------
what name should we give to store, think about uniqness
where can we store, local? VM? third party, location?
how frequent we can access?
how much size
is it serverless?
how can we store?drang and drop?upload?CLI?programme?
how can we access?direct url hit? download?CLI?programme?
what kind of data can we store?
single object size
remmeber all storage class names and availability, durability
lifecycle
versions
how can we reduce cost of storage
what kind of encriptions
what is the command to create bucket/copy/move
how can you give temporary access
